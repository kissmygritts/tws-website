I grew up with a passion for deer and bird hunting in Northern Minnesota with my family that ultimately guided me to a career in Wildlife Ecology. Following high school, I stayed in Minnesota, first to study Biology and Environmental Science at St. Olaf College, and then to study Wildlife Ecology at the University of Minnesota (Go Gophers!). 

My research at the U of M provided me with my first western field experience; I studied home range and habitat selection of California Spotted Owls in the central Sierra Nevada under the leadership of Rocky Gutiérrez. I had a wonderful experience in the Sierra Nevada that would ultimately influence my decision to move to Reno several years later. After completing my MS at the U of M, I joined the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a Wildlife Biologist and worked first for Kevin Brennan at the Fergus Falls Wetland Management District, and then Joe Robb at Big Oaks National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Indiana. 

As a Wildlife Biologist I studied Waterfowl, Crawfish Frogs, and Henslow’s Sparrows, among other species. After three years as a Refuge Biologist, I enrolled at Colorado State University to pursuit a PhD in Wildlife Ecology with Bill Kendall, and an MS in Statistics with Mevin Hooten. My PhD and MS focused on methods for incorporating population dynamics and decision theory in wildlife management. Upon completion, I stayed at CSU for a Post-Doc with Mevin Hooten, studying sea otters in Glacier Bay, Alaska. I started at University of Nevada, Reno in July, 2018. Nevada was an attractive place to move for many reasons. The surrounding ecosystems are fascinating, the faculty in NRES and EECB are top notch, and there is great collaboration between the University and state and federal wildlife agencies. 

My current research centers around using statistical and mathematical methods for estimating population processes to improve wildlife management and conservation. Examples of student projects in our lab include: understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of sage-grouse lek attendance in Nevada; movement, habitat use, and population dynamics of ravens; spatio-temporal population dynamics of waterfowl in the western U.S.; and modeling sea otter distribution and abundance in southeastern Alaska to understand potential conflicts with marine fisheries. 

I currently teach two courses at University of Nevada, Reno: Dynamics and Management of Wildlife Populations, an undergraduate capstone course for the Wildlife Major, and Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology, a graduate course focused on developing and fitting Bayesian hierarchical models to ecological data. Additionally, I teach a number of workshops and short-courses including: Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Model Selection; Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Statistical Models; Developing Reproducible Research; and Introductory R. 

I am thrilled to be at the University of Nevada, Reno and have the opportunity to be part of the Nevada Chapter of the Wildlife Society.
